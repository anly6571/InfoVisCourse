    <h1>Black Farmers in the United States</h1>
    <div id="intro_text">
      <p>
        In 1910, approximately one in seven farmers were african-american. In
        the century that followed, there has been a 90% loss of black-owned
        farmland in the US. As of 2017, black farmers make up just 1.3% of all
        producers, even though 13.4% of the US’s population is black. According
        to the USDA’s 2017 Census of agriculture, 3.2 million producers are
        white, 95 percent of the U.S. total.

        The USDA 2017 Census of Agriculture defines a producer as “a person who
        is involved in making decisions for the farm operation. Decisions may
        include decisions about such things as planting, harvesting, livestock
        management, and marketing”. Demographic data were collected for up to
        four producers per farm. Each farm has at least one principle producer,
        which is the data that these visualizations explore.

        Percentages of black producers are highest in southern states, such as
        Mississippi (12%), Louisiana (7%), South Carolina (7%), Alabama (6%),
        and Georgia (4%). In the majority of other states, this number lies
        below 2%.
